// The release gate for what's new (JOS-73): a tag may not ship without release notes.
//
// The app tells the user what changed by reading src/shared/releaseNotes.ts, which is committed
// SOURCE — so the failure mode is not a crash, it is silence: tag v0.9.0, publish it, the fleet
// auto-updates, and the What's new panel simply has nothing to say about the build everybody is
// now running. Nothing anywhere would have complained. This is the thing that complains, in the
// one job that publishes.
//
// It runs the SAME `releaseNotesProblems` the unit suite runs, so the shape rules have one
// definition, and adds the only rule CI can check that a checkout cannot: the tag being built
// must have an entry. A prerelease tag (`v0.9.0-rc.1`) satisfies it with 0.9.0's entry — the
// prerelease is that release, being rehearsed.
//
// Usage: node --import tsx scripts/check-release-notes.mjs [<tag or version>]
//   With no argument it checks the notes' SHAPE only, which is what a local run wants.
//   Exit 0 = fine, exit 1 = the reason, on stderr.
