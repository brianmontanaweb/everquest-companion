// smokeTelemetry.mts — the PURE half of the post-release smoke test's telemetry leg.
// ============================================================================
//
// Same split as smokeLog.mts / smokeGate.ts: everything that can be decided without a database
// or a VM lives here, so `tests/smokeFeedback.test.mts` can pin it and the script next door is
// left holding only side effects (poll, print, delete).
//
// THE LEG IT SERVES. After the feedback half passes, the host asks a different question of the
// same live stack: the installed app in the VM has an anonymous `analyticsId` — did the counts
// it sent actually arrive? Two facts answer it, and they are deliberately of different kinds:
//
//   * `analytics_install` HAS A ROW FOR THAT ID. This is the per-id proof, and it is the only
//     per-id row the whole feature creates. Its presence means a batch from THIS install passed
//     the validator, the kill switch and the daily cap, and was aggregated.
//   * `usage_daily` CARRIES A SESSION METRIC FOR TODAY. This is a population fact, not an
//     attributable one — the counters are anonymous sums with no id in them, and nothing can
//     (or should be able to) pick our contribution out of them. It is asserted anyway because
//     an install row with no counters beside it would mean the aggregate transaction is broken.
//
// AND A THIRD VERDICT, NOT A FAILURE. `telemetry_accepting` is the OWNER'S switch. With it
// closed, every batch is answered 503, no row is created, and there is nothing to find. That is
// the switch working, so the leg reports LIT-BUT-CLOSED and the run still passes — exactly the
// treatment the feedback half already gives its own kill switch.

/**
 * The `usage_daily` metrics that mean "a session happened". Any ONE of them for today is the
 * proof the aggregate write landed; which one depends on how long the VM left the app running
 * and whether it closed cleanly, and pinning a specific one would make this leg flaky for a
 * reason that has nothing to do with the pipeline.
 *
 * These are `USAGE_METRICS` members (src/shared/telemetryRollup.ts) — spelled here as data
 * rather than imported so that a metric being RENAMED is caught by the test below instead of
 * silently following the rename into a smoke test that no longer checks anything.
