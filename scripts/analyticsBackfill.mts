/**
 * analyticsBackfill.mts — COPY FIRST. NOTHING IS DROPPED UNTIL A VERIFIED COPY EXISTS.
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * The one-off transition that gives the two usage-counter tables their `cohort` key on a
 * cluster that already has the PRE-COHORT shape — the state the v0.4.0 smoke test proved is
 * live (`column "cohort" does not exist`). Those counters have been accumulating since
 * 2026-08-04 behind a lit client, so they may hold REAL USERS' rows and not only the owner's
 * testing. The previous runbook said to `DROP TABLE usage_daily` and re-migrate. That is a data
 * loss, it was written when the tables were believed to be unapplied, and the owner's
 * instruction is the plain one: **we shouldn't drop anything.**
 *
 * WHY A COPY AND NOT AN `ALTER`. `cohort` is part of the PRIMARY KEY (the ingest path's
 * `ON CONFLICT (day, cohort, metric, dim)` needs those four columns to BE the uniqueness rule),
 * and no PostgreSQL — least of all a distributed one, where the key IS the data's distribution —
 * can add a column to a primary key in place. So the new shape is a NEW TABLE, and the rows are
 * copied into it.
 *
 * WHY THE FINAL NAMES DO NOT CHANGE: **Aurora DSQL supports `ALTER TABLE … RENAME TO`.** It is
 * in the documented supported syntax, verbatim —
 *   ALTER TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] name RENAME TO new_name
 * — and the description says "There is no effect on the stored data"
 * (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/alter-table-syntax-support.html).
 * That is the same page this repo already cites for the fact that DSQL has no `DROP COLUMN`, so
 * it is the same evidence standard. Because the rename exists, the staging tables can be swapped
 * into the real names at the end and NOTHING ELSE MOVES: `infra/schema.sql`, the Lambda's
 * INSERTs, `usageStore.ts`'s SELECTs and every constant in between keep naming `usage_daily` and
 * `usage_funnel_daily`. A world where the rename did not exist would have had to leave the data
 * under `*_v2` and re-point every reader — strictly worse, and unnecessary.
 *
 * GRANTS SURVIVE THE RENAME (privileges attach to the object, not to the name), which is why
 * this file grants `telemetry_ingest` on the STAGING tables: after the swap the Lambda finds the
 * access it needs on the table that now carries the real name. Forgetting that would produce a
 * permission-denied on the first batch after re-opening.
 *
 * FOUR STEPS, EACH SAFE TO STOP AT — nothing here is destructive until the last one, and the
 * last one refuses unless the copy verified:
 *
 *   1. `analytics backfill-cohort`  create the staging tables (shape taken from schema.sql
 *                                   itself, so it cannot drift), grant, fill
 *                                   `analytics_install.cohort`, COPY every counter row.
 *   2. `analytics backfill-verify`  old vs new, per table: row count AND the sum of `n`.
 *   3. `analytics backfill-swap`    re-verifies, REFUSES on any mismatch, then per table:
 *                                   DROP the (now redundant) original, RENAME staging into its
 *                                   place. One DDL per transaction, a DSQL law.
 *   4. (the runbook) `terraform apply` puts the cohort-aware Lambda live, then `analytics open`.
 *
 * THE COHORT IS DERIVED, NEVER GUESSED. A counter row carries no id — that is the whole point of
 * the aggregate-on-arrival design — so the only honest source is `analytics_install`, which
 * states each install's `channel` and its first/last seen day. `cohortForDay` below spells out
 * the rule and its fail-safe direction.
 *
 * WHY THESE STATEMENTS DO NOT LIVE IN `src/main/triage/store.ts` with every other analytics
 * statement: that module is the APP's read surface, compiled into the dev build's main process.
 * A one-off `DROP TABLE`/`RENAME` path has no business being reachable from a panel. It lives
 * here, beside the CLI that runs it, and it takes `Clients` as an argument so it can be driven
 * by a fake in `tests/analyticsBackfill.test.mts` without an AWS credential in sight.
