// PER-ABILITY AA LEDGER — law 5's allocation identity, decomposed by ability instead of summed.
//
// WHAT THE LOG STATES AND THE OLD PANEL DID NOT SAY. Every AA purchase line names ONE
// (ability, rank) step: the quoted form is always rank 1 (`You have gained the ability
// "Innate Regeneration" at a cost of 1 ability points.`) and the improved form carries the rank
// it moved you TO (`You have improved Innate Regeneration 7 at a cost of 5 ability points.`).
// So the log states a LADDER per ability — and the flat purchases list rendered every rung as an
// unrelated row, ordered by date. Measured on the real log (post-epoch): 140 purchase lines
// collapse into 52 abilities; one of them (Innate Regeneration) is a 7-rung ladder whose rungs
// sat six rows apart in the flat list, and the total it cost you appeared nowhere.
//
// THE IDENTITY IS PRESERVED, NOT RE-DERIVED. The per-rank dedupe rule here is the SAME one
// `computeAAAccounting` applies (latest purchase per (ability, rank) wins; cost-0 auto-grants
// excluded from the money) — so Σ `invested` over these rows is EXACTLY `allocated`, and
// Σ `paidRanks` is EXACTLY `boughtCount`. tests/aaLedger.test.mts pins both equalities against
// the real log; if the ledger ever disagreed with the headline, one of them would be lying.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* CLAIMED (law 1 / law 6). A rank below `topRank` with no purchase
// line in this log is reported as UNLOGGED, never as "missing" or "not owned": the log window is
// the only evidence there is, and `Symphonic Aura: Disabled` first appears at rank 9 with no
// rungs 1–8 anywhere in 1.35M lines. Whether those rungs were bought before logging started,
// granted, or renamed is a question the log cannot answer, so the row says the ranks were not
// logged and stops there. Likewise `rebuys` is stated as re-purchases, not as respecs: a
// second purchase of the SAME rank is the only refund signal the log carries (there is no
// refund line), so it is evidence OF a respec, not a count of them.
