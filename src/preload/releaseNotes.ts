// preload/releaseNotes.ts — the what's-new half of the app bridge (JOS-73). Two methods.
//
// Its own module, spread into `api` in index.ts, for the same reason ./perf.ts, ./graphics.ts
// and ./dev.ts are: that file sits at the repo's 400-code-line factoring ceiling and the answer
// to that is a split, not a widened threshold. On `window.eq` these two are indistinguishable
// from the methods written out there.
//
// THE NOTES DO NOT CROSS THIS BRIDGE. `src/shared/releaseNotes.ts` is committed source the
// renderer imports directly (the bundler inlines it, like the spell DB), so what travels here is
// exactly one string: the release this install has already been shown.
