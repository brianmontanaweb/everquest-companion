// roster.ts — the slice of the main app's bridge that is about WHO YOU ARE GROUPED WITH
// (docs/plans/group-model.md §3).
//
// A separate file for FILE MASS, not for scope: src/preload/index.ts sits at the measured
// 400-code-line ceiling and the rule here is to split rather than ratchet (windows.ts and
// perf.ts are the same pattern). This object is spread into that bridge, so both methods below
// are ordinary members of the one `window.eq` surface.
//
// WRITES ONLY, and that asymmetry is the design rather than an omission. The roster READ path is
// `CombatSnapshot.roster`: it rides the snapshot both meter surfaces already poll, so the scope
// chip and the rows it filters are answered by ONE call and can never describe two different
// groups. Only the corrections need a channel of their own.
//
// These are the top rung of the provenance ladder (user > joined > stated > confirmed) and the
// only roster state that survives a replay — everything else is re-derived from the log every
// time. The name is re-validated and canonicalized in main against the same pattern the parser
// requires: a name the parser could never produce is a key that could never match, and storing
// one would be a permanent silent no-op.
