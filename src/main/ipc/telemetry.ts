// IPC: usage analytics — the six channels behind `window.eq.track()` and the Preferences pane.
//
// EVERY RENDERER-SUPPLIED VALUE IS VALIDATED HERE, at the boundary, not deeper in and not
// "because today's only caller is the app's own UI". Same law as `sounds:getData`'s packId and
// `feedback:submit`'s draft, and it matters more here than usual: the renderer is where the
// strings of this app live (character names, zone names, search boxes, alert text), and the
// entire promise of this feature is that none of them can reach the buffer.
//
// `validateTelemetryEvent` is the SHARED validator — the same function the renderer's own
// `track()` shim runs before sending, and the same one wave A2's ingest Lambda will run on
// arrival. It CONSTRUCTS its result field by field from the schema, so an event carrying an
// extra `characterName` property does not get "sanitized"; the property simply never appears in
// the value that is buffered.
//
// `telemetry:track` is a SEND, not an invoke: it is fire-and-forget by design (the renderer must
// never wait on a counter), so an invalid event is dropped silently on this side. That is the
// right failure mode for analytics and the wrong one for anything else — nothing a user does
// depends on it having worked.
