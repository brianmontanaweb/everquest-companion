// alertDefMigrations.ts — one-time rewrites of SHIPPED alert defs already sitting in a user's
// store, for the case where the app changed its mind about what a curated def should match.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, AND WHY IT IS NOT A SCHEMA MIGRATION. `storeMigrations.ts` owns
// changes to the SHAPE of the persisted file — every reader must see a shape it understands, so
// that chain is version-stamped, append-only and runs before anything reads the store. Nothing
// here changes a shape: `cooldownScope` is optional and absent means what it always meant. What
// changes is a VALUE the app once authored and now authors differently, and the only honest rule
// for that is "rewrite the copy the app wrote; never touch the copy the user wrote". That is
// exactly the rule `migrateAlertSounds` (data/defaultPacks.ts) already follows for retired sound
// packs, so this module follows its precedent to the letter: a pure function over the alert
// list, a separate integer stamp in the store, run once from `getAlerts()` and never again.
//
// THE INCIDENT (owner, 2026-08-04, verified twice against eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt). The
// rogue-slow def matched `where:{effect:'slow'}` under ONE alert-wide 30 s cooldown, and THE
// GLOBAL CLOCK ATE THE FIRST SLOW ON A FRESH MOB: Weakening Strike landed on King Tranix at
// 22:31:16 (fired) and on a fire giant warrior at 22:31:43 — 27 s later, so it was SUPPRESSED
// and the add's slow was never announced. The player died at 22:33:40. A re-land on the mob you
// are already fighting must not silence the first slow on the mob you just pulled. The engine
// answer is `cooldownScope:'target'` (modules/alerts.ts), and step 1 below carries an existing
// user's stored def onto it.
//
// THE SAME WAVE ALSO WIDENED THE TRIGGER, AND THE OWNER SENT IT BACK. Step 1 shipped a trigger
// of `/^(slow|spellSlow)$/` so the def would also fire on Clumsiness Strike, the CASTING slow
// (`<mob>'s fingers slow down.`). Living with it for an afternoon: "i dont want the spell cast
// time slow to count. one proc, one family." Step 2 reverts exactly that half — the trigger goes
// back to `effect:'slow'` and the per-target scope, which was the real fix, stays.
//
// APPEND-ONLY, LIKE EVERY MIGRATION CHAIN HERE. `STEPS` is ordered and never renumbered; a
// store runs the steps NEWER than its own stamp and nothing else. Two live stores prove why the
// chain has to exist rather than one "set it to today's def" rewrite: the owner's dev store was
// stamped 1 by the shipped build and holds the WIDENED trigger, while an un-relaunched store is
// still unstamped and holds the ORIGINAL one. 1→2 lands both on `effect:'slow'` + target scope;
// a single step keyed on either shape would leave the other behind.
//
// EVERY STEP'S OUTPUT IS A FROZEN LITERAL, never `poisonSlowAlertDefs()`. Step 1 used to read
// today's shipped def, which was fine for exactly as long as the def never changed again — the
// day it did (today) that step would have silently started writing something no build ever
// wrote. The literals below are BYTES PAST BUILDS WROTE, which is fixed history: pinning them is
// what keeps step 1 the step that shipped, not an edit of it.
//
// WHAT IT WILL NOT DO. Each step matches its input trigger EXACTLY, deep-equal. A user who
// edited the def — narrowed it, widened it, turned it into a composite, pointed it at another
// effect — has stated an intent, and no step touches that def at all. Everything the user chose
// about the def they did keep (sound, volume, cooldownMs, name, note, speech, enabled) is
// preserved verbatim; only the trigger and the cooldown SCOPE ever move.
