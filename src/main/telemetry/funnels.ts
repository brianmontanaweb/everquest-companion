// telemetry/funnels.ts — the ONCE-EVER half of the schema: who actually reached each step.
//
// The funnel STEPS have been in the contract since it was written (TELEMETRY_FUNNEL_STEPS), the
// server has aggregated them since wave A2, and the Analytics tab has rendered them all along —
// as a column of zeros, because nothing ever called `recordEvent` with one. The panel was
// therefore telling the truth about the instrument and a lie about the world: "nobody has ever
// finished a first run" reads as a catastrophic product failure and meant "we never measured it".
// This module is the missing half, and it is deliberately the ONLY place a funnel step is minted.
//
// WHY ONCE-EVER, AND WHY IT IS PERSISTED. `first-run` and `voice-install` ask how far an INSTALL
// ever got. Every step of both may therefore contribute at most one event for the life of the
// install: a step that could re-fire would count tab switches rather than installs, and the
// panel's conversion ("of the installs that reached step 1, how many reached step 2") would run
// past 100% by construction. The marks live in the telemetry PREFS blob rather than in the event
// ring because the ring is disposable by design — it is dropped on opt-out, on rotation and on
// any unreadable file — and a mark that went with it would let `installed` fire twice on one
// machine.
//
// THE FEEDBACK FUNNEL IS NOT HERE. Its three steps are per-REPORT, not per-install (a second
// report is a second dialog, and its conversion is the interesting number), so it is emitted
// straight through `track()` from the renderer and always has been.
//
// FAILURES ARE NOT MARKS. `recordFunnelFailure` records the attempt WITHOUT consuming the
// once-ever mark, so a voice download that fails, is retried and then succeeds produces both the
// failure and the eventual success. Marking on failure would make "installs that finished the
// download" permanently unmeasurable for anyone who had one bad night.
