//
// Split out of `smokeFeedback.ts` for the same reason `triage/rows.ts` is split out of
// `triage/backend.ts`: the interesting decisions here are decisions about MEANING — is the
// hook armed, what does the report say, which of four outcomes was that — and they must be
// provable without Electron, without a network and without a build.
//
// NOTHING IN THIS FILE IMPORTS ELECTRON. The one non-type import is `MIN_DESCRIPTION` from the
// shared contract, so `tests/smokeFeedback.test.mts` loads this module directly. The runner
// next door owns everything with a side effect.
//
// THE GATE IS TWO CONDITIONS AND BOTH ARE LOAD-BEARING:
//   * `EQ_SMOKE_FEEDBACK` non-empty — the hook is opt-in; every ordinary launch skips it.
//   * NOT under `EQ_E2E=1` — THE HARNESS NEVER SUBMITS. That law predates this file
//     (feedback/submit.ts's first gate, e2e.ts) and this hook must not become the one path
//     that quietly breaks it. `submitFeedback` would refuse anyway; refusing here means an E2E
//     run never even builds a slice.

import { MIN_DESCRIPTION } from '../shared/feedback'
// TYPE-ONLY, and deliberately so: importing the value side of `./feedback` would drag Electron
// in and this module would stop being loadable from a plain node test.
