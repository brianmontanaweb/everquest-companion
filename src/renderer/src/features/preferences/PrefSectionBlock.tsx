// PrefSectionBlock — one Preferences section as it is drawn, plus the ARRIVAL PULSE.
//
// Its own file for the reason PerfSetting's descriptor is: PreferencesView.tsx sits at the
// repo's 400-code-line factoring ceiling, and the answer to that is a split, not a threshold.
// This is a coherent piece to split off — everything about how a section LOOKS when you land on
// it, with PreferencesView keeping what the sections ARE and which one is showing.
//
// WHY THE PULSE EXISTS. A deep link ("Set up in Preferences" on an alert row, the telemetry
// notice's details link) opens this view already switched to the right section — correctly, and
// completely silently. The user clicked a sentence about voices in one tab and got a settings
// page in another, with nothing connecting the two ends; the section they were sent to looks
// exactly like the section they would have reached by hand. The pulse is that connection: the
// landed cards breathe an accent outline twice and settle. Long enough to be seen, short enough
// that it never becomes decoration, and one-shot state rather than a style (PreferencesView
// clears it on a timer).
//
// REDUCED MOTION KEEPS THE INFORMATION, NOT THE MOVEMENT. Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
// the animation is replaced by a plain static outline held for the same interval, so "which of
// these is the thing I clicked" still has an answer.

 * short scroll box floating in a tall empty pane is the wrong answer for it. So it claims the
 * remaining height: this block becomes a flex column that grows, its card grows inside it, and
 * the card's own content is then free to put a scroll box at the bottom of the chain.
 *
 * `minHeight: 0` appears at EVERY rung, and it is not decoration. A flex child's default
 * `min-height: auto` refuses to shrink below its content, so one rung without it and the whole
 * column grows past the pane — the list stops scrolling and the PAGE starts, which is exactly the
 * failure AGENTS.md records for the combat log. The Paper additionally needs
 * `display:flex; flexDirection:column`, because a growing card whose content does not also grow
 * is just a taller box with the same short content in the top of it.
 *
 * OPT-IN, NEVER THE DEFAULT: every other section must size to its content, and a Preferences pane
 * where the Voice card stretched to the window bottom would be worse everywhere in order to make
 * one card right.
