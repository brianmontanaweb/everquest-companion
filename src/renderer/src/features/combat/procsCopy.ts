// It used to serialize the whole analytics surface (coats, slow lines, two rate denominators,
// Tier-A contribution, the span ledger, the Tier-B effects report with deduped footnotes); the
// panel it mirrored is now a glanceable list, and the law that made this file worth keeping is
// that the paste is what the user is LOOKING AT. So it shrank with the panel, and both read the
// SAME `procListRows` — a second spelling is exactly how a paste and a screen start disagreeing.
//
// Every number here is folded on ingest by the engine from the authoritative event stream —
// never from the capped/truncated event ring — so this block carries NO `~` estimate treatment
// and no APPROX footer. That is the one structural difference from formatMobsText, which IS
// ring-derived. The `~ <lane>` mark that DOES appear means something else entirely: the game
// left that lane's NAME ambiguous (a shared emote). The count is exact.
