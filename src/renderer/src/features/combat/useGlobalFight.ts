// GLOBAL FIGHT SELECTION — the renderer half (docs/plans/combat-overlay-parity.md P4/P5/P6).
//
// ONE HOOK, BOTH BUNDLES. The Combat tab's fight picker, the 'fight' overlay's selector and the
// 'heal-fight' overlay's selector are three different chromes over one fact: which fight the app
// is looking at. They all call this, because the two preload bridges expose the SAME three
// members under the SAME names (`getFightSelection` / `setFightSelection` / `onFightSelection` —
// see preload/windows.ts and preload/overlay.ts). The bridge is a PARAMETER rather than a
// `window.*` read so this file stays honest in both entries and testable in neither's presence.
//
// It is the `petRows.meterPanel` pattern applied to selection: one implementation, three
// surfaces, no place left for a second answer to live.
//
// MUI-FREE (the overlay bundle imports it) and value-imports `shared/*` RELATIVELY (the overlay
// entry and node both resolve no `@shared` alias for values — the repo-wide mobSearch precedent).
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it never touches a surface's Fight-vs-Overall SCOPE (P5), and a
// zone-session selector never calls it at all (the ruling's carve-out — 'overall' and
// 'heal-overall' keep their own per-overlay selection).

 * The selected fight, and the setter every fight-scoped selector calls.

 * HYDRATE THEN SUBSCRIBE: a window that opens after the last change (a freshly spawned overlay)
 * must not sit on the sentinel while every other surface shows fight 41, so it asks once and
 * then rides the broadcast.
 *
 * THE WRITE IS OPTIMISTIC: local state moves this frame and main echoes the same value back to
 * every window including this one, so the selector never lags its own click by a round trip and
 * there is still exactly one authority.
 *
 * `bridge` is optional because an HMR reload can render a frame before the preload has re-run.
 * With no bridge the hook is a constant sentinel — the surface renders its default, which is
 * the same honest degradation a stale id gets (P6).
