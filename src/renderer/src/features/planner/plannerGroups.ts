// planner/plannerGroups.ts — HOW THE EFFECT BROWSER'S LIST IS GROUPED (V4, docs/plans/planner-v2.md).
//
// The browser used to fold its donors exactly one way — `groupByEffect()`, hardcoded — and that
// fold was the ceiling on every request of the 2026-08-05 owner round: "show me the best of each
// focus family", "let me browse a slot at a time", "which of these are Kunark". So the fold became
// a DECLARED AXIS, and this module is the whole of it: donors in, header-and-row model out, no
// React and no storage.
//
// THE OUTPUT IS STILL ONE FLAT UNIFORM ARRAY, because `useWindowedRows` is a fixed-row-height hook
// and the list must stay a bounded scroll box (AGENTS.md UI conventions). A header is a ROW of the
// same height as a donor row, not a container — expanding a group is a longer array and nothing
// else. That is the constraint the whole shape here exists to satisfy.
//
// PURE, AND NODE-TESTABLE ON PURPOSE (`tests/plannerGroups.test.mts`): value imports are RELATIVE
// (the repo-wide mobSearch precedent), the only thing taken from `plannerData` is a TYPE, and the
// era verdict — the one fact here that needs the mob catalog — is INJECTED as `eraOf`. W-A's
// layered verdict is the single owner of "which expansion is this donor in"; this module reads it
// and never re-decides it.
//
// A DONOR CAN APPEAR UNDER MORE THAN ONE HEADER, and only on the slot axis: a sword the wiki gives
// PRIMARY and SECONDARY is genuinely both, so it is listed under both. Every other axis is a
// function of the row, so the groups partition it.
