// planner/plannerProgress.ts — "how far along are you already?", joined onto a planned socket.
//
// DECORATION, NEVER A PREREQUISITE (design D6). Three independent sources answer three different
// questions, and every one of them is allowed to know nothing:
//   * the INVENTORY dump — do you hold a copy right now,
//   * your LOOT HISTORY — have you ever looted one (a copy you sold, gave away or merged still
//     proves the camp works),
//   * the OBSERVED MERGE TIER — how far up the upgrade ladder this character has actually taken
//     it, straight from the log's own merge lines (`useItemTiers`).
// A character with zero dumps, zero loot and zero merges renders every socket as `planned`. That
// is the correct state, not a degraded one, and nothing here throws to say so.
//
// ONE CHIP PER SOCKET, and it is derived law-1-honestly. The tier the log SAW always wins over
// the counts, because "+2 of the +4 you need" is a strictly better answer than "you have one":
// it is the only number that says how much farming is left. An unseen merge is UNDEFINED, never
// 0 — a donor you have never merged shows `have donor`, not `+0/+4`, because we did not observe
// a +0 (observedTierOf's contract).
//
// KEY FAMILY. `PlannerDonor.key`, `itemCountKey` and `itemTierKey` are the same spelling —
// lowercased, ` +N` stripped — so all three joins hit without a translation table. The ONE
// exception is the inventory dump, whose keys are lowercased but NOT `+N`-stripped
// (main/inventory/parseInventory.ts): a dumped "Ghoulbane +2" would key as `ghoulbane +2` and
// silently miss. It is re-folded through `itemCountKey` here, which is also what makes an
// upgraded copy count as the copy it is.
