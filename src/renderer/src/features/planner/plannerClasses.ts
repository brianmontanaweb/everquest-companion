// planner/plannerClasses.ts — THE SET'S CLASS TRIO IS A FILTER, NOT A RULE (V2, docs/plans/planner-v2.md).
//
// The shipped planner seeded a set's classes ONCE, at creation, from the inferred combo — and then
// orphaned them. The owner's live case is the whole argument: after a loadout switch and a Sky
// clear the app knew the trio was `pal enc mnk` and the planner still filtered on `rog pal ber`,
// with no way to say so. So a set now declares WHERE its trio came from (`ExaltPlan
// .classesProvenance`) and the two answers behave differently:
//
//   detected → the filter FOLLOWS live inference. A loadout switch rewrites it, silently and
//              correctly, because nobody has said otherwise yet.
//   user     → the filter is PINNED. Detection never overwrites it; when the two disagree the
//              toolbar offers "detected: PAL ENC MNK — apply", which is one click and reversible.
//
// AND NOTHING IS EVER ENFORCED BY IT. That is the other half of V2 and the reason this module has
// a mismatch function rather than a validity function: a donor outside the filter is HIDDEN by the
// browser like any other filtered row, and a donor already sitting in the build that no longer
// matches is KEPT and highlighted (`classesMismatch`, drawn as a chip in the same family as the
// era chip). Re-inference must never be able to invalidate work — it can only ever point at it.
//
// PURE AND NODE-TESTABLE (`tests/plannerClasses.test.mts`), the plannerGroups precedent: value
// imports are RELATIVE, nothing here touches React, storage or the corpus.
