// navOrigin — the app's ONE back-continuity rule, as pure functions (JOS-43).
//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR: every cross-view deep link in the app (a planner donor name, an
// Overview drop row, a Sky quest item, a raid card, a toast) drops you into a drill-down whose
// Back button knew only one destination — the TOP OF ITS OWN LIST. Click a donor in the Planner,
// read the item, press Back, and you are staring at the loot ledger you were never in.
//
// THE CONTRACT: a deep link carries its ORIGIN, and Back returns THERE. The list is the
// back-target only when you genuinely came from the list.
//
// A STACK, not a slot, because links chain: a toast can land you on Mobs from Loot, which you
// reached from the Planner. Popping one at a time unwinds the trail in the order you walked it.
//
// WHAT PUSHES AND WHAT CLEARS is the whole design, and it is here rather than in the hook so it
// can be read (and tested) without React:
//   • an ANCHORED cross-view link (one carrying a drill payload — an item, a mob, a fight, a
//     quest, a level) parks the view it is leaving;
//   • a BARE opener is a plain tab switch, not a drill (the drops card's "All loot", the leveling
//     card), so it clears — there is no drill to press Back in, and whatever was parked belongs
//     to a journey the user has just ended;
//   • a link that re-anchors the view you are already ON parks nothing and disturbs nothing: you
//     did not travel, so the trail behind you is still the trail behind you;
//   • MANUAL navigation — a nav-drawer row, the title bar's Preferences — clears, because a
//     hand-driven tab switch is the user saying where they are going;
//   • a NATIVE drill (clicking a row in the list you are standing in) clears, which is the
//     "genuinely came from the list" half of the contract.
//
// SESSION-LIFETIME AND NOTHING ELSE: no localStorage, no IPC, no persistence. A relaunch starts
// you on a tab, not mid-journey.

// TYPE-ONLY, and that is deliberate: `appViews` reaches `devFlags`, which reads
// `import.meta.env` and therefore only evaluates inside a bundler. A type import is erased, so
// this module stays plain enough for `node --test` to load it (AGENTS.md: node-tested pure
// modules). The caller resolves the display label (VIEW_LABELS) and hands it in already formed.
