// NoLogsEmptyState — the fresh-machine answer, lifted out of App.tsx (JOS-43).
//
// It moved for the reason appRouting.ts moved: App.tsx is a COMPOSITION (title bar, nav, content,
// toasts, dialogs) sitting on the measured 400-code-line ceiling, and a self-contained leaf
// component with no app state in it is the cheapest thing in that file to stop owning. Behaviour
// is identical — the markup below is the markup that was there.
//
// WHAT IT SAYS AND WHY. No `eqlog_*.txt` was found in the (auto-detected or Settings-overridden)
// EQ folder. Quiet and actionable: it names the two things that fix it — turn logging on in-game,
// or point the app at the install folder — and hands over a button to the place that does the
// second. Showing empty or erroring feature views instead would make a solvable setup problem
// look like a broken app.
