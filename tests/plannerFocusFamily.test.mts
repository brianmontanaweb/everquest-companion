// V5 — THE FOCUS FAMILY PARSER, against the REAL committed corpus.
//
// The Roman numeral in an effect's name is the ONLY magnitude signal the item corpus carries: no
// percent, no level, no magnitude field exists on any focus row. So the Focus tab's whole ordering
// — group by family, sort tier-desc, crown the best — stands on `parseFocusEffect` reading three
// characters correctly. A hand-written fixture would prove nothing about that; this runs the
// shipped parser over every focus effect name the shipped builder emits.
//
// TWO LAYERS, the same shape as the rest of the planner suite:
//   1. THE CORPUS SWEEP — every distinct focus name parses, no name loses its stem, and the
//      per-name results are printed so a rescrape that invents a new spelling is readable rather
//      than merely red.
//   2. THE HAND CASES — the three shapes the corpus contains (Roman rank, arabic bard modifier,
//      no rank at all) plus the ones it does not, which are the ones a future scrape might.
//
// LAW 1 IS THE POINT OF THE THIRD SHAPE: "Minion of Air" has no numeral, and that does NOT make it
// tier 0 of some guessed family. An unranked focus name IS its own family, at tier 1.
