// Store schema migrations for VOICE ALERTS: 3 → 4 (the feature arrives) and 7 → 8 (its master
// switch is retired).
//
// A companion to `storeMigrations.test.mts` (the framework itself: chain integrity, the file
// half, the failure/downgrade policy) and `storeMigrationsPresence.test.mts` (step 4→5), for the
// reason both of those cite: that file sits at the repo's 400-code-line factoring ceiling, and
// the answer is a split, not a widened threshold. The two voice steps live TOGETHER because the
// second one reads what the first one wrote — see `normalizeLegacyVoicePrefs` in
// storeMigrations.ts, and the "survives the WHOLE chain from v3" test below.
//
// WHAT THE STEP IS FOR. `VoicePrefs.enabled` is gone from the model, the UI and every runtime gate
// (owner, 2026-08-04: "duplicative settings; you should not have to enable voice in Preferences").
// An alert speaks because ITS OWN `audio` says 'speech'/'both' — that is the entire switch now.
//
// WHY A MIGRATION IS REQUIRED AT ALL, and this is the whole content of the file: SIMPLIFYING A
// SETTING MUST NOT CHANGE WHAT A USER HEARS. The retired switch degraded spoken alerts to their
// pack SOUND while it was off (never to silence), so a user who left it off — the default — has
// alerts that say 'speech' and have been playing sounds for their entire life. Ship the removal
// without this step and every one of those alerts starts talking on update: the app overruling a
// preference on the same day it deleted the control for it.
//
//   voice.enabled          alert.audio            after v8
//   ---------------------- ---------------------- ----------------------------------
//   true                   'speech' / 'both'      unchanged — it spoke, it still speaks
//   true                   'sound' / absent       unchanged
//   false / absent / junk  'speech' / 'both'      key DELETED ⇒ 'sound' (what it was playing)
//   false / absent / junk  'sound' / absent       unchanged
//   (every case)           —                      `voice.enabled` is gone from the file
//
// The `speech` block SURVIVES a rewrite: it is inert on a sound-only def, and it is the user's own
// phrase and voice choice. Re-picking "Voice (spoken)" in the row must find their words intact.
