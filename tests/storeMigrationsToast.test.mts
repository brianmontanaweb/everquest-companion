// Store schema migration 8 → 9: the celebration toast defaults ON (owner, 2026-08-05: "it should
// be on by default").
//
// A companion to `storeMigrations.test.mts` (the framework and steps 1→4) and its siblings
// (`…Presence` 5, `…Telemetry` 6, `…Perf` 7, `…Voice` 4+8), for the same reason those are
// separate files: the first is at the repo's 400-code-line factoring ceiling, and the answer to
// that is a split, not a widened threshold.
//
// WHY A DEFAULT FLIP NEEDS A MIGRATION AT ALL. A default only decides the value of an ABSENT key,
// and `overlays.toast` is written to the store on the first launch of any build that touches the
// overlay config — not only when a user reaches for the switch. So the toast overlay, which
// shipped the day before with `open: false` (like the five meters it is not much like), is
// already recorded as OFF in every store that has run that build. Changing the default alone
// would leave all of them off forever, which is precisely the "silently does nothing" outcome the
// owner was reporting.
//
// AND WHY FLIPPING A STORED `false` IS HONEST HERE. The feature was hours old: no stored `false`
// in existence is a decision to decline it — they are yesterday's default, written down. The step
// is pinned to this one version, so a user who turns the toast off tomorrow writes `false` into a
// v9 store, this step never runs against it, and their switch stays where they put it. That is
// the difference between correcting a default once and an app that re-enables things.
//
// The step deliberately does NOT touch the stray `overlays.toast.toast.sound` / `.volume` keys
// that the same commit stops reading (the sound picker is gone — the seeded boss/quest ALERTS own
// that audio). Dropping a READ of optional keys needs no migration: every reader defaults, and
// `normalizeToastConfig` simply stops emitting them the next time the blob is written.
