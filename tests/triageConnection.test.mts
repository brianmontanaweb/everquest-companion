// THE DROPPED SOCKET — the failure the app showed the owner as a raw node-postgres string, and
// showed itself as four uncaughtExceptions in three seconds.
//
// EVIDENCE (%APPDATA%\everquest-companion-dev\errors.log, 2026-08-05T10:39):
//   [main:uncaughtException] Error: Connection terminated unexpectedly
//       at Connection.<anonymous> (node_modules/pg/lib/client.js:199:73)
// Four of them, ~1s apart. pg's client raises the drop as an ASYNC 'error' EVENT when no query
// is in flight, and an EventEmitter with no 'error' listener THROWS — so the whole main process
// took it as an uncaught exception. `infra/lambda/db.ts` has had that listener since it was
// written; `src/main/triage/store.ts` did not. Four rather than one because the Analytics tab
// reads three tables with `Promise.all` and the cached handle was assigned only after the await,
// so every read opened its OWN socket.
//
// THREE CLAIMS, and each maps to one of those facts:
//   1. LIFECYCLE — an async 'error' is listened for (the emit does not throw), the dead handle is
//      retired so the next statement reconnects, and N parallel statements open ONE connection.
//   2. CLASSIFICATION — a connection failure is told apart from a SQLSTATE, by message OR by the
//      node system-error `code`, and a real SQLSTATE is never mistaken for one.
//   3. THE DEGRADE — the analytics read answers `available:false, state:'unreachable'`, which is
//      the same shape the tab already renders for a missing table, and an error that is NEITHER
//      still throws (a degrade that swallows everything would hide the next real bug).
//
// No AWS, no cluster, no credentials: `makeClients` takes an `open` seam and `awsBackend` takes
// a `Clients` factory, both added for exactly this. The suite never skips.
