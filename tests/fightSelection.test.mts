// GLOBAL FIGHT SELECTION — the model, the validator, and the pin that keeps three selectors on
// one channel (P4/P5/P6 of docs/plans/combat-overlay-parity.md).
//
// The owner ruling: "picking a fight in the combat panel or ANY overlay switches every
// fight-scoped surface (app + overlays). Overall (zone-session) selection stays per-overlay."
// Three things have to stay true for that to be more than a coincidence of wiring, and each of
// them is a test below:
//
//   THE VALUE MODEL is closed. Exactly two shapes are a fight selection — the '__live__'
//   sentinel and an engine encounter id — and main validates renderer input against it, so a
//   zone-session id can never land in the global and break the carve-out by accident.
//
//   THE SENTINEL IS ONE STRING. The renderer's `LIVE_SELECTION` and main's `LIVE_FIGHT` are the
//   same constant; two spellings of '__live__' would be a cross-process disagreement no
//   typechecker could see.
//
//   THE THREE SELECTORS SHARE ONE SEAM. The Combat tab's picker, the 'fight' overlay and the
//   'heal-fight' overlay all drive `useGlobalFight`, both preload bridges expose the same three
//   members, and the zone-session selectors call none of it. This is the same one-builder pin
//   tests/combatPetNesting.test.mts keeps over `meterPanel`.
//
// P6 (a stale id degrades, it does not clear) is deliberately pinned as a property of the
// VALIDATOR here — a well-formed id for a fight that has aged out is ACCEPTED — because the
// degradation itself belongs to the engine (`resolveSelectedId` falls back to its own default,
// which tests/goldenWindows.test.mts and the e2e harness already exercise).
