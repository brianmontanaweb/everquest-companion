// The celebration toast's QUEUE + HOVER-PIN semantics (docs/plans/celebration-toasts.md T8).
//
// Every timing rule the toast has is a pure reducer over an explicit `dtMs`
// (src/renderer/src/overlay/toastQueue.ts), which is what lets this file assert them in
// milliseconds instead of by watching a window: no DOM, no timers, no Electron, never skips.
//
// The rules under test, stated as the product states them:
//   * a card holds for its own duration, then plays a 300 ms exit and is gone;
//   * pointing at a card PAUSES that card — and only that card;
//   * leaving a card resumes it with a ~1.5 s grace, so it never vanishes under your pointer;
//   * three cards is the cap, and a fourth evicts the OLDEST, never the newest;
//   * arrival order is render order (newest underneath);
//   * a repeat id refreshes the card on screen instead of stacking a duplicate.
