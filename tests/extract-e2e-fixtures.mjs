// E2E FIXTURE EXTRACTOR — one committed log per e2e spec (docs/plans/e2e-parallel.md, wave E2).
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Until this landed, every spec in tests/e2e/ launched the app against the
// OWNER'S LIVE LOG: 1.4M lines, still growing, different on every machine and different from
// itself an hour later. That made a red spec ambiguous ("bug, or quiet log?"), made ~10.8 s of
// redundant hydration the price of every one of the suite's launches, and pushed a dozen
// assertions down to "note()" branches that never actually assert anything. Each spec now
// replays a SMALL, COMMITTED slice instead — the same bytes on every machine, forever — and
// the "live gameplay" half is scripted by the harness appending lines to the tailed copy
// (tests/e2e/logFixture.mts, the append driver).
//
// WHAT IS EMITTED. One `tests/fixtures/e2e-<spec>.log` per spec, cut from the REAL log and
// routed through the shared scrub (tests/fixture-scrub.mjs → src/shared/logScrub.ts) exactly
// like every other extractor in this directory. Never hand-copy a raw span in here: the repo
// is public and the scrub is the only thing standing between a bystander's chat and GitHub.
//
// THE SPANS ARE STATED, NOT GUESSED. Each entry below names the real line range it cuts and
// what that range CONTAINS — the fights, the zone changes, the loot, the dings — because that
// content is what the spec's assertions rest on. The ranges are re-derivable: the anchors are
// printed as the first/last kept line of every emitted file.
//
// A fixture is MINIMAL on purpose. The smallest slice that still supports the spec's
// assertions is the right one: it replays in milliseconds, it is readable by hand when a
// spec goes red, and it keeps a public repo from carrying a hundred megabytes of one person's
// evenings.
//
// Usage (the loader matters — the shared scrub is TypeScript):
//   node --import tsx tests/extract-e2e-fixtures.mjs "<path to eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt>"
