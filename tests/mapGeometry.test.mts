// The map viewer's PURE geometry (src/renderer/src/features/maps/mapGeometry.ts) — the whole
// boundary between "the file says these coordinates" and "the user sees this pane".
//
// WHY THIS BOUNDARY EXISTS. Four things here are silently wrong rather than loudly broken, and
// each of them is a bug you can stare at for an hour:
//
//   * THE COORDINATE CONVENTION. `/loc` prints (North/South, West/East, Elevation) and EQ's
//     world grows larger to the WEST and NORTH, so the map file stores (-EW, -NS, Z) — which
//     grows EAST and SOUTH. Get a sign wrong and the map is mirrored — which looks like a
//     perfectly good map of a zone you have never been to. That is precisely what shipped in
//     v0.6.3 ("North for South. East to West is accurate"), because the plan asserted the world
//     grew south and the render flipped y to compensate. It is pinned below TWICE: by name here,
//     and end-to-end through the real parser on real records from both packs (JOS-65, bottom).
//   * CURSOR-ANCHORED ZOOM. If the anchor drifts, zooming "walks" the map away from the cursor.
//     It still zooms, so nothing looks broken; it just feels wrong forever.
//   * THE CULL. Too eager and walls vanish at the edge of the pane; too lazy and the 26,383
//     segments of everfrost.txt are all drawn every frame.
//   * THE CLAMPS. Without them the map can be flung into empty space with no way back.
//
// Arithmetic only — no React, no DOM, no canvas, no fixture — so this suite NEVER skips.

// THE DEFECT THIS PINS (user report, v0.6.3): "The maps all appear inverted. North for South.
// East to West is accurate, but N-S is reversed." The plan (§2.1) said EQ's world grew west AND
// SOUTH, so map-file y — which is `-NS` — would grow north and the renderer flipped y to put it
// on screen. The west half was right; the south half was not. One wrong word, one spurious
// negation, every zone mirrored on one axis only.
//
// WHY IT IS PINNED END TO END rather than on `project` alone: the sign lives in the file, and a
// unit test written against the same wrong belief passes just as happily. So these records are
// REAL BYTES, copied verbatim out of a live `<eqRoot>\maps` (two P records per case, cited by
// pack and file), driven through the real main-side parser and the real renderer transform —
// `parseMapText` → `buildMapData` → `fit` → `project` — and the assertion is about the SCREEN.
// Both packs are covered because a pack-specific convention was a live hypothesis until measured;
// they agree exactly, so the seam is one transform and never a per-pack correction.
//
// WHY OASIS OF MARR. The Desert of Ro runs North Ro → Oasis → South Ro, so the zone's two exits
// are a compass with no ambiguity to argue about, and both packs label them in their own words.
// Corroborated (not duplicated) by North Karana, which states its southern and its eastern and
// western exits in one file and so pins BOTH axes from one zone — including the axis that was
// never broken, which is what stops a future "fix" from over-rotating the map.
