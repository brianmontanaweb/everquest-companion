// PURE unit tests for the Overview leveling card's AA LINE — the read that survives the level
// cap (`aaLine` inside overviewLevelingData.ts, shaped by leveling/aaPaceRows.ts).
//
// ITS OWN FILE, like `overviewLevelingTiles.test.mts` beside it: `overviewLeveling.test.mts`
// pins the LEVELS half of the same fold and is at the 400-code-line factoring ceiling, and this
// is a different subject with a different failure mode. The builders are duplicated on purpose
// — a snapshot literal shared across three test files is a fixture nobody owns.
//
// WHY THIS SURFACE EXISTS AT ALL. Every other number on that card is built on stated level-bar
// percentages, and at max level the game stops stating them: the headline becomes an honest
// em-dash and the next-level projection refuses itself, exactly when AA becomes the whole game.
// These pin the answer that keeps working, and the three rules it obeys:
//
//   1. ABSENT, NEVER EM-DASHED. No completion in the hour ⇒ no line at all (law 1). A character
//      who is not earning AA is told nothing about AA rather than shown a row of unknowns, and
//      an old completion the window does not reach is not evidence about this hour either.
//   2. THE RATES ARE THE LEVELING TAB'S OWN SPELLING of the same hour (`aaRateText`), printed
//      TOGETHER and adjacent: they are equal until an item-shop bottle is running and diverge
//      while one is, and that divergence is the entire reading. The potion doubles what a
//      completion PAYS and never how fast completions arrive.
//   3. THE INFERRED WAIT CARRIES ONE WORD, and disappears rather than explaining itself. The log
//      holds no AA-experience line anywhere — there is no bar position to sum — so the wait is a
//      model over the window's own rhythm, labeled 'est.' and nothing more (AGENTS.md, the
//      tooltip and caveat diet). When that rhythm runs out (one completion, or a silence long
//      past the mean gap) the segment is simply gone; the Leveling tab's tile is where the
//      refusal and its reason live.
//
// Imported RELATIVELY: node tests run through tsx with no `@shared` / `@renderer` aliases.
