// The OWNER-TOOLING gate (JOS-72) — src/shared/ownerTools.ts, both directions.
//
// WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. A stranger recompiled this public repo for native macOS and ran it. A
// self-compiled build is not `app.isPackaged`, so the old predicate on the Triage tab — "am I a
// dev build?" — was TRUE on their machine and the owner's feedback-backlog tab appeared in their
// nav drawer. The fix is a second term, an explicit `EQ_OWNER_TOOLS=1` opt-in that no fresh
// checkout has, and the thing worth pinning is the DEFAULT: absent means hidden, in every shape
// an absence can take.
//
// AN ABSENCE TEST ALONE IS THE WEAKEST KIND (the character-sheet e2e says the same thing), so
// every case here is paired with its opposite — the same call with the opt-in present must
// answer YES. Default-hidden and opt-in-visible, at the one seam both ends read.
//
// Pure functions, no Electron, no network, no fixtures: this suite NEVER SKIPS. It cannot be an
// e2e, because `ownerToolsEnabled` refuses under `EQ_E2E=1` by design — the headless harness
// builds production-shaped and must stay off the owner's AWS account entirely.
