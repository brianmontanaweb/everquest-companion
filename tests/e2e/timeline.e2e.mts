/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for the COMBAT TIMELINE's SIZING — the owner's
 * "the combat timeline flickers when its surface is smaller than the timeline; it moves back and
 * forth quickly" (2026-08-04).
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN SPEC rather than another step in combat-dashboard.e2e.mts: that file and its
 * harness are both at the 400-code-line factoring ceiling, and this needs the window RESIZED to
 * cramped sizes — a state no other assertion there wants to share.
 *
 * WHAT THE BUG WAS, and therefore what this measures. `timelineMetrics` derives lane height from
 * the available HEIGHT, and the left label gutter steps 132 → 148 → 168px as lane height crosses
 * 26 / 32 — so once the plot is clamped at its minimum width, the SVG's WIDTH is a step function
 * of the measured HEIGHT. Pointing the ResizeObserver at the SCROLLING box closed a loop through
 * Chromium's layout: the SVG overflows → a scrollbar appears → the measured content box loses
 * 12px on the CROSS axis → lane height drops under a gutter threshold → the SVG narrows → it
 * fits → the scrollbar leaves → the box grows back → forever. tests/timelineGeometry.test.mts
 * pins that arithmetic (it finds hundreds of container sizes with no fixed point); this spec
 * pins the DOM the arithmetic runs in.
 *
 * FOUR ASSERTIONS PER SIZE, and the third is the one that cannot rot:
 *   1. the chart's WIDTH never moves at a fixed window size — the loop's fingerprint, and the one
 *      dimension a LIVE fight cannot change (new lanes make it taller, never wider);
 *   2. no geometry value is REVISITED across six samples — the general form of "it oscillates",
 *      stated so that a live fight growing monotonically taller is not mistaken for one;
 *   3. the MEASURED element is not a scroll container at all (`overflow: visible`), which is what
 *      makes 1–2 structural rather than lucky. A debounce would satisfy them for a while and
 *      still be an oscillation;
 *   4. the frame keeps a usable box — the absolutely-positioned scroller leaves it with a flex
 *      basis of 0, so without its `minHeight` floor a short window resolves it to 0px and the
 *      chart disappears (MEASURED at 900×420 while building this).
 *
 * Sizes are deliberately CRAMPED — the report is specifically about a surface smaller than the
 * timeline — and the window minimum is lifted to reach them, exactly as the responsive step in
 * the dashboard spec does.
 *
 * HONESTY: the Timeline view needs a selected fight that actually has an event ring. A quiet log
 * may have none; that is `note()`d and the size assertions are skipped, never faked.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e`.
