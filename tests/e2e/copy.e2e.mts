/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for COPY-TO-CLIPBOARD (the combat panels' copy affordance).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS: the copy buttons did nothing. They called `navigator.clipboard.writeText`,
 * which Chromium gates on the 'clipboard-sanitized-write' permission — and this app denies EVERY
 * web permission wholesale (`hardenSession`, src/main/windows.ts), deliberately and permanently.
 * So every click rejected with `NotAllowedError: Write permission denied.` and nothing ever
 * reached the clipboard, while the UI showed no error a user could see. The copy now goes
 * through main (`clipboard:write` → Electron's `clipboard` module, which is not a web API and
 * consults no permission).
 *
 * WHY IT IS AN E2E SPEC AND NOT A UNIT TEST: what broke was the SEAM between a real Chromium
 * renderer and a real permission policy. Every layer was individually correct — the serializer
 * produced the right text, the API call was well-formed, the policy did exactly what it says —
 * and nothing short of driving the real app and reading the real OS clipboard could see it. The
 * only honest proof is: click the button a user clicks, then ask the main process what the
 * clipboard now holds.
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN FILE: one spec per surface (like the Overview and Maps specs), all sharing
 * `appHarness.mts` and running back to back from `npm run test:e2e`. `EQ_E2E=1` (src/main/e2e.ts)
 * shows no window, skips the single-instance lock and points `userData` at a throwaway temp dir,
 * so this runs invisibly beside the user's game and dev app.
 *
 * IT PUTS THE USER'S CLIPBOARD BACK. This is the machine's REAL clipboard and the user may be
 * mid-copy, so the prior text is read first and restored afterwards — but only when there WAS
 * text: restoring '' would clear an image or a file the clipboard is holding in a format
 * `readText` cannot see.
 *
 * Identities only, never today's numbers: the assertion is that the clipboard stopped holding
 * the sentinel and now holds the panel's own serialization — a subject line ending in the
 * fight's ` · m:ss` duration (`copyTable.subjectLine`), followed by more lines.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e`
