/**
 * settle.mts — WAIT FOR THE CONDITION, NEVER FOR THE CLOCK (docs/plans/e2e-parallel.md, wave E3).
 *
 * The audit that grounds this counted ~60 raw `sleep(n)` calls across the suite: 800 ms after a
 * toggle, 1200 ms after a resize, 1500 ms after hydration. Every one of them is a BET on render
 * latency — and the bet loses exactly when the machine is busiest, which since wave E1 is most of
 * the time: the runner now runs four Electron apps at once, on purpose. A sleep that is long
 * enough to be safe under that contention is also long enough to make the suite slow for everyone
 * else. A condition is neither: it returns the instant the thing happened, and it fails loudly
 * (with the last value it read) when the thing never did.
 *
 * FOUR SHAPES, and they are deliberately few:
 *   • `settle(read, ok)`      — poll a reading until it satisfies a predicate. The general case.
 *   • `settleCount(page, sel)`— poll a selector's match count. The common case.
 *   • `settleGone(page, sel)` — poll for its disappearance.
 *   • `settleStable(read)`    — poll until the reading STOPS CHANGING. This is the answer to the
 *     absence assertions: "the panel is not there" is only information once the layout has
 *     finished moving, so you wait for the POSITIVE signal (a settled measurement) and then
 *     assert the absence, instead of sleeping 1.5 s and hoping that meant the same thing.
 *
 * Every one of them RETURNS WHAT IT LAST READ rather than throwing, because the caller is an
 * assertion harness: a failed wait must become a `check(..., false, <what it saw>)` line in the
 * run's output, never an exception that skips every assertion after it.

 * The honest replacement for the short sleeps that followed a pointer move — those layers are
 * rAF-coalesced by design, so "the frame happened" is the real condition. But this suite drives a
 * window that is NEVER SHOWN (`EQ_E2E=1`), and a window Chromium is not compositing may throttle
 * `requestAnimationFrame` to almost nothing or stop it entirely — the same fact that makes the
 * failure screenshots best-effort. MEASURED 2026-08-06: a bare two-frame wait against the hidden
 * window took two full seconds. So the frames are RACED against a short timer: on a compositing
 * window this returns in ~16 ms, and on a hidden one it can never become a stall.
 *
 * NO named function bindings inside the callback: tsx/esbuild's `keepNames` wraps
 * `const f = (…) => …` in a `__name` helper that lives in the NODE bundle, and Playwright ships
 * only the callback's source to the page (appHarness.mts learned this the hard way). Nested
 * anonymous arrows are the shape that survives.

/**
 * Move the REAL pointer to a fractional offset inside `sel`'s VISIBLE box.
 *
 * Real, not synthetic, on purpose: the renderer then sees a genuine `pointermove` carrying
 * `ev.buttons === 0`, which is the exact condition the hover/drag seam bails on — a hand-
 * dispatched event would have to assert `buttons` itself and would prove nothing about the seam.
 *
 * "VISIBLE" IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM, and getting it wrong is what kept the leveling range-drag spec
 * red (MEASURED 2026-08-06: the level chart's box was 838..994 in a window 860 tall AND clipped by
 * the charts column's own scroller, so the old maths — clamp to the viewport only — put the drag
 * at y=848, which `elementFromPoint` resolves to the app's content area, not the chart. The
 * pointer handlers never saw a single event; the harness had been dragging a different element for
 * as long as the spec had existed). So this now:
 *   1. scrolls the element into view (a no-op when it already is, so a drag's later moves cannot
 *      move the ground under it),
 *   2. intersects its rect with EVERY clipping ancestor's rect, then with the viewport,
 *   3. VERIFIES with `elementFromPoint` that the point it computed actually lands inside the
 *      element — and returns false rather than moving the mouse somewhere meaningless.
 *
 * Returns false when the element is absent, entirely clipped away, or covered. That is the
 * caller's decision to note or fail — never a thrown harness error, which would skip every
 * remaining check in the session.
